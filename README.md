Appointment System created with Java 11, JavaFX, and the IntelliJ IDEA CE IDE.  Utilizes the DAO Implementation method.

This application is a fully featured Appointment System that allows a company to create, edit, delete and get reports on Appointments, Customers, and the Contact person involved in those appointments.  It features a login page for secure access, as well as language functions depending on the users default language (default is English; French is implemented).  It will also translate the timezone of the user to the appropriate UTC for the backend MySQL database, and vice versa.  The limitations of hours for appointments have been implemented for the EST time zone based on the requested business requirements (8am - 10pm EST).
